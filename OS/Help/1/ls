NAME
    ls -- list files in directory

SYNOPSIS
    ls [-adlx] [dir ...]

DESCRIPTION
    ls sequentially prints the contents of each specified directory. If no
    directory is specified, it prints the contents of the current directory.
    Directories are signified in blue with a trailing slash, and executables are
    signified in red with a trailing asterisk.

    ls can list the contents of object directories in the object manager
    namespace if the path is prefixed with //:/.

    The switches are as follows:

    -a      Display files beginning with a period.
    -d      Display information about the directory itself, not its contents.
    -l      Display more detailed information.
    -x      Don't perform an ioctl on stdin to determine terminal width.
