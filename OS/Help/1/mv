NAME
    mv -- move file

SYNOPSIS
    mv source target

DESCRIPTION
    mv moves the source file to the target. If the target path ends in a forward
    slash character, it will try to move the source file into the target
    directory and retain the source file's original name. If it doesn't, it will
    try to move with the new target name.
