NAME
    shutdown -- shutdown the system

SYNOPSIS
    shutdown

DESCRIPTION
    shutdown causes a shutdown to occur. The caller must be the root user. The
    kernel shutdown process begins by sending SIGTERM to all processes. It then
    waits for a short period for all of the processes to clean up, and then
    forcibly destroys them with SIGKILL. It waits another short period and then
    flushes all modified pages to disk, and then the kernel exits.
