NAME
    SystemInit -- system initialization program

SYNOPSIS
    SystemInit

DESCRIPTION
    SystemInit is the first program that the kernel runs. It establishes:

  1) The system console device.
  2) The default pagefiles.
  3) The managed device lines.
  4) The system server processes.

    To establish the system console device, SystemInit attempts to open several
    devices in sequence, in the order of :ttyV0, :ttyS0, and finally :ttyS1. The
    first that succeeds is set as the system console.

    The latter two things are established at the direction of a configuration
    file which is located at /mintia/SystemInit.cfg. An example of the contents
    of this configuration file is as follows:

                        @PageFile
                        name='/mintia/pagefile.sys'
                        minsize='0x400000' #4MB
                        maxsize='0xC00000' #12MB
                        priority='0'

                        @Servers
                        /mintia/amssrv.exe

                        @Managers
                        /mintia/launchtty.exe :ttyV0
                        /mintia/launchtty.exe :ttyS0
                        /mintia/launchtty.exe :ttyS1

    Each @PageFile section defines a default pagefile that will be created at
    boot time. The pagefile parameters function the same as those specified in a
    (1)swapon command line.

    Each key in the @Managers section defines a managed device line. The value
    is the name of the managed device, and the key is the path to the program
    that will be used to manage it.
