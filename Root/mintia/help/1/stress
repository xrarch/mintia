NAME
    stress -- stress test the system

SYNOPSIS
    stress testname ...

DESCRIPTION
    stress runs the specified stress test.

    The available tests are as follows:

    nullptr             Cause a segfault.
    swap [areasize]     Swap aggressively on a private memory area.
    forkbomb            Spawn infinitely recursive processes.
    overflow            Cause a stack overflow.
    fastmutex           Recursively lock and unlock an OSFastMutex with many
                        threads.
    streamread          Open and read from many OSStreams at once.
    streamwrite         Open and write to many OSStreams at once.
                        WARNING: will create a large file in the current
                        directory named 'streamtest'.
    cfgread             Read a test config file many times.
    cfgwrite            Write a test config file many times.
    ipcserver           Start a test IPC server.
    ipcclient           Start a test IPC client.
    infiniteloop [ms]   Runs in an infinite loop. If the ms argument is provided
                        then it will call OSThreadSleep.
    cacheflood [file]   Creates a file of the given name and truncates it to
                        16MB. Maps it and dirties as many pages of it as it can,
                        as quickly as possible.
    asyncio             Creates a file of the given name and truncates it to
                        512K. Enqueues asynchronous write operations to it.
    openclose [file]    Opens a file at /testfile and closes it repeatedly.
    nullsys             Measures the time it takes to perform 100k syscalls.
    sysabort            Causes a system crash. Can only be invoked by a
                        privileged user.
    jobs                Perform several tests involving job objects.
