NAME
    users -- manage the system's users

SYNOPSIS
    users command [args ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This utility is used to manage the users on the local workstation. It
    accepts a command argument, and each command may support multiple additional
    arguments. This utility cannot be used to change passwords of an existing
    user, (1)passwd must be used for that.

    The commands are as follows:

    list    Prints a list of all of the registered users.

    info username/uid
            Prints information about the given user.

    add username password groupname
            Creates a user with the given username and password, and with
            default properties. Will automatically create a home directory if
            possible.

    delete username/uid
            Deletes the given user. This will prompt as to whether you wish to
            automatically delete the home directory for the user as well.

    edit username/uid property value
            Edits a property of the given user. Some properties expect numeric
            values and others expect textual values. The textual values are:

          * group
          * username
          * home
          * shell

            The numeric values are:

          * poolquota
          * pgpoolquota
          * vmquota
          * wsquota

            The quota values also accept the text strings "infinite" and
            "default" to specify a limitless quota and a system-default quota
            respectively. "default" is highly recommended unless there are
            justifying factors, since it automatically adjusts to the available
            resources in the system, and explicitly defined quotas will not.
            Changes to quota may not take effect until the next logon.
